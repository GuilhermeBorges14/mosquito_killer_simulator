# Mosquito Killer Simulator

### About the Project

Mosquito Killer Simulator helps you to kill mosquitos in a digital world!
The project was developed with Python language (3.10.9 version) and also some libs.
The first one an more important is _Mediapipe_ from Google, an open source framework based in Machine Learning, which provides ML solutions for live and streaming media.
Another important open source library is _OpenCV_, for the computer vision and image processing, perfect to use with ML.
Also was used _numpy_ and _math_ for the operations.

### How to install

Fisrt, we need install python.

So, install this packages:

### How to run the project

Make sure that your camera is able to capture your image.
Open the project in your text editor ( I recomend Visual Studio Code ) and run the python file _main.py_, so the project will run.
Some mosquitos will appear on the screen. With your index and thumb finger, smash then and watch the magic happen.
To close the project you can press the key "_q_" in your keybord or put the tip of the index finger in close button.
